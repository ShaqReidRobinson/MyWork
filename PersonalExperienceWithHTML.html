		<h3>Week One - Learning about HTML 5 and the basics</h3>
		<h4>Published on <time datetime="2012-10-05">October 05, 2012</time></h4>
		</header>
<p>During the first week of Web Development, we began learning the basics tools 
   used within Web Development such as <strong>Adobe Dreamweaver, HTML-Kit, Notepad++ etc.</strong><p>
   <p>We also began learning the ins and outs of <strong>HTML 5</strong> along with the standards and 
   how we will be applying it to our work, such as combining it with CSS in order 
   to make a 'flashy' website.<p> 
   <p>I personally have very little to no experience
   with web development, so this was all very new to me.

		<h3>Week Two - HTML Markup Basics</h3>
		<h4>Published on <time datetime="2012-10-12">October 12, 2012</time></h4>
		</header>
<p>Within this lecture, we started talking about various <strong>HTML</strong> terminology that we will be constantly using during
   our work.<p> 
   <p>We started off learning about "Elements" and "Attributes" and various rules that come with them,
   such as 'tags must always be closed' and 'elements must be in lowercase'.<p> 
   <p>Structure played
   a big part during the lecture as it is very important to learn how to structure your HTML wisely
   to avoid errors and mediorce presentation.</p>

    <h3> Week Three - HTML Section elements and hypertext.</h3>
	<h4>Published on <time datetime="2012-10-19">October 19, 2012</time></h4>
	</header>
	<p>Within this lecture, we learnt about various HTML elements such as <strong>Div elements</strong> and <strong>section elements.</strong></p>
	<p>We applied this to our websites in order to make it more structured and tidy, thus making coding the website a lot less arduous.</p>
    <p>With applying div/section elements to our work, we can easily style our website without the need to enter constant lines of descriptive CSS coding
	everytime we want to style something.</p>
	<p>With a quick div element edit, we can easily apply the selected style of our choice to whatever<br />
	part of the website you are constructing.</p>

	<p> Here is an example of a screenshot being added to a website.</p>
	<p> However, there is far more things you can do than just simply
	dropping the image randomly on your website.

	<h3>Week Four - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h3> 
	<h4>Published on <time datetime="2012-10-26">October 26, 2012</time></h4>
	</header>
	<p>This week's lecture was focused on the amazing things you can do with CSS</p>
	<p>We were also taught on how important it is to style a website accordingly,
	in order to present ourselves more professionally to the Internet.
	Having a website with dull text like Times New Roman and/or no colour whatsoever will imply to the people browsing the website 
    that you are boring, lazy, and can't design properly or even design at all.	
	<p>We were shown good examples of CSS being used successful to produce eye-catching webpages that had:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Decorative Borders</li>
	<li>Opacity</li>
	<li>Rounded Corners</li>
	<li>Animation</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Just to name a few.</p>
	<p>Although we were given a large range of tools at our exposal from this lecture,
	we were warned to keep our website designs simple but creative, as "Less is More"</p>

	<h3> Week Five - CSS Box model and layout</h3>
	<h4>Published on <time datetime="2012-11-02">November 02, 2012</time></h4>
	</header>
	<p>Today's lecture covered more CSS layouts, how to properly use them, and The CSS Box Model</p>
	<p>We started off the lecture to more or less an introduction to what the CSS Box Model is,
	Another important way on how to structure our wesbite using it's components such as:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Margin</li>
	<li>Padding</li>
	<li>Border</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="big">Structures... STRUCTURES EVERYWHERE</p>
	<p>From learning about this, we also took in account things such as Pixels Per Page and how
	it will fit on various devices such as Androids to Desktops</p>
	<p>We also spoke briefly about adding colour to the box model and how we would go about doing that.</p>

	<h3> Week Six - More CSS layout</h3>
	<h4>Published on <time datetime="2012-11-09">November 09, 2012</time></h4>
	</header>
	<p>Within this week, we began our stylesheets and started adding CSS to it, which in turn, made it look
	like a half decent-looking website.</p>
	<p class="big">
	Finally... COLOUR!!!</p>
	<p>I began to appreciate the use of classes and div id's as I had started to use and customize
	them every so often when I wasn't satisfied with the look of my website</p>

<p>Today's lecture was about styling some hypertext. Simple. This involves styling things such as internet links, 
web text for search engine purposes, and various fonts.</p>
<p>We also touched on Search engine mechanics and how web users view each internet link accordingly

	<h3> Week Eight - Images for the Web</h3>
	<h4>Published on <time datetime="2012-11-23">November 23, 2012</time></h4>
	</header>
<p>Images... Very crucial when coding your CSS. Especially when choosing from ranges of file types such
as GIF, Vector, and other types of image effects. What is most important about using images on your website 
is positioning them corresponding to how your text is laid out</p>
<p>What I mean is that you wouldn't want an image blocking your text, so be careful when
embedding images/videos into your website.</p>

	<h3> Week Ten - Building on the website</h3>
	<h4>Published on <time datetime="2012-12-07">December 07, 2012</time></h4>
	</header>
	
<p>I dedicated this week on more independant research and coding my website. I didn't learn 
anything new, but managed to get more work done.</p>

	<h3> Week Eleven - Testing, Referencing and Evaluation</h3>
	<h4>Published on <time datetime="2012-12-14">December 14, 2012</time></h4>
	</header>

<p>I have now began testing the website thoroughly for any bugs I may have overlooked. 
To aid me with this, I'm constantly validating my HTML using the W3C Validator, with also helps 
lay out my code more neatly.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I consider my website to be above my expectations marginally as I felt that I could have 
made the CSS more stylish and eye-catching, but however, most of my ideas for such design required JavaScript 
which restricted my imagination as I'm not fluent in JavaScript yet.</p>

<p>Also, whilst positioning my website, I wasn't sure how I was going to position it. Whether to have things float left, right or center, 
or even have the webpage be viewed horizontally rather than a traditional vertical view. In the end, I managed to come to equal ground with it and positioned it well in my own opinion.</p>

<p>However, when embedding my video into my tutorial I didn't have the correct codecs for it to be viewed in Mozilla Firefox, and can only be viewed in Google Chrome. The advanced stylesheet for the 
tutorial is a bit temparamental in Google Chrome as the CSS will sometimes not work for unknown reasons or if the page has been refreshed on that stylesheet. This corrects itself when I click on the "Beginner's Tutorial" link in the navigation bar. 
The navigation bar may sometimes disappear when the CSS is not working, this also corrects itself from being refreshed. This problem doesn't occur in Firefox and works perfectly, disregarding the missing video codecs.</p>

<p>On the other hand, creating a website that runs fine and look presentable was the number one priority, as I did manage to fulfill that objective, which indeed is a good thing for only eleven weeks worth for lectures.</p>

<p>The screenshots/footage taken for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 tutorial are from the video game "Sonic the Hedgehog 2" which is owned/published by the Sega Corporation and created by Sonic Team. I use these images/footage purely for education uses and NOT
 for any financial benefits or ownership of any kind.</p>
<p>My original raw footage for the "Sonic the Hedgehog 2" was in WMA format. I use a file converter program named "Handbrake", created by "HandBrake Project", allowed me to convert my WMA file into MP4 file. From doing that
I was able to upload my video to my tutorial page.</p>
